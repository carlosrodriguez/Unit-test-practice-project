Unit Test practice project.

Current situation:
The unit-test.html showcases a list of products with checkboxes used to select products to compare. The page is supposed to only allow four items to be selected.

The problem:
The current script used from old-script.js although working has the following issues:
1. The code is hard to test as it does multiple things.
2. Even though you get a warning stating you can't select more then four products when trying to add a fifth one, you can still select more than four products.

What you need to do:
1. Use jquery and create unobstrusive, testable code.
2. Write tests for your code.

Instructions:
1. Fork the project into your own account.
2. Clone the project into your local repository from your own fork.
3. Create a new file "script.js" for your new code.
4. Create your test js and html files inside the test folder.
