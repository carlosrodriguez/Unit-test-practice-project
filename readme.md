##Your mission, if you choose to accept it

Create a script that can take the value of an input field, distinguish between a zip code and a state and call the corresponding services:

* testingState.aspx?state=STATE
* testingZip.aspx?zip=ZIP

Note:
 
* If both a zip code and state are passed ignore the state and call the zip code service.
* State must be passed as a two letter state code but spelled out states will be accepted. Ei: Florida, must be passed as testingState.aspx?state=FL
